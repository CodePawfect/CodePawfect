As a seasoned software developer with a focus on Java, I am now expanding my skillset to include frontend development. In addition to honing my technical abilities, I am also a dedicated learner, currently taking on the challenge of learning piano. In my free time, you can find me spending quality time with my furry companion, my dog. With a passion for both technology and personal growth, I am always striving to improve and take on new challenges.
