Hello and welcome to my profile. My name is Alex, I am 31 years old and I am from Germany, near Munich. I am currently looking for motivated Java developers who have experience with Spring. You are welcome to connect with me. Either through the LinkedIn badge or through Discord at mDyingStar#2339. I am a passionate Java developer myself and engage as a contributor in various open source projects. In my free time, I play the piano, enjoy playing with my dog, and take long hikes through the woods and fields.
