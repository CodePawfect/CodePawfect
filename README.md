I thrive on the thrill of coding and the power it holds to transform ideas into reality. With a relentless curiosity and a commitment to continuous learning, I'm always on the lookout for innovative solutions to complex problems. My expertise lies in web application development with spring boot and java/ kotlin.

Beyond my coding prowess, I actively contribute to the welfare of furry friends as a dedicated dog foster. By providing a loving and temporary home to dogs in need, I strive to make a positive impact on their lives and find them forever homes. It's a fulfilling social endeavor that keeps me grounded and reminds me of the importance of compassion in everything I do.

Follow along as I embark on exciting coding adventures, building applications, solving challenges, and making a difference, one line of code at a time. Let's connect and collaborate on projects that push boundaries and make the world a better place.
